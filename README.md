C++ Sandbox
===================


This folder is continuously updated with all the code I usually write in C++.
Usually I program in C++11/14 so in this folder a might put also same sample of code that I tested most probably compiling it on clang 

Folders (this list might change ... )

- ***functional*** 
comparison between a bunch of stl algorithms and tail recursive ones written by me

- ***heap allocator*** 
delving into the details of the system calls brk/sbrk and mmap in order to understand how the heap works. The allocator implemented uses a best fit algorithm

- ***mpi_fun*** 
explicit parallelism using openMPI, framework that I used to develop my master thesis

- ***multithreading *** 
collection of c++11 std::thread snippets of code and the presentation I gave to the Cpp Meetup in Dublin

- ***sample code*** 
every single piece of code that I tested or some C++ feature I wanted to try and understand goes here
